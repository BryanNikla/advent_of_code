# Advent of Code

## To Run Code
Execute code using NodeJS: 

`node index`

This will prompt you for the year & day. Answer with either a number for the year and day. If you answer with 'all' or no answer for either question, it
will act for 'all';

You can also pass a day and year argument to skip directly to that day:

`node index.js -year 2023 -day 01`
