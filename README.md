# Advent of Code

## To Run Code
Execute code using NodeJS: 

`node index`

This will prompt you for the year & day.

| Question | Options                                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Year?    | 2022, 2023, or no answer for current year             |
| Day?     | 1-25, 01-25, all, or no answer will also run all days |


---

You can also pass a day and year argument to skip directly to that day:

| Argument | Options          |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| -year    | 2022, 2023, all  |
| -day     | 1-25, 01-25, all |

Example:
`node index.js -year 2023 -day 01`
